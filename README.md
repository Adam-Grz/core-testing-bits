# core-testing-bits

This repository contains installation instructions and examples in Python and JavaScript for:

• Concurrent test execution

• HTML reporting


## Python

### Installation, packages

First of all, install Python. I suggest the latest 2.x version. During the installation setup select the option that adds Python to PATH.
Then install these packages:
```
pip install pytest
pip install pytest-xdist
pip install pytest-html
pip install requests
```

`pytest` is a framework which allows you to easily write and run your tests. The `xdist` extension is used for concurrent test run, and the `html` creates html reports.

The `requests` library will help us fetch some url data.
